<div class="FAQ">
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h4>Can I make recipe substitutions?</h4>
<p1>Your final product made with the substituted ingredient may differ slightly from the original food, but it will still be acceptable in flavor, texture and appearance. For example an equal amount of oil can be substituted for a similar portion of melted butter if the recipe specifies using melted butter.</p1>
<h4>Can I substitute gluten free flour in your recipes?</h4>
<p1>If the original recipe calls for 260 grams of all-purpose flour, substitute with 260 grams of your blend. Beat the batter more. Because gluten-free flours provide less structure than all-purpose, the batter or dough you make with them may require more beating than that which you are accustomed.</p1>
<h4>Why do my cookies always turn out flat?</h4>
<p1>When cookies turn out flat, the bad guy is often butter that is too soft or even melted. This makes cookies spread. The other culprit is too little flour—don't hold back and make sure you master measuring. Finally, cookies will also flatten if placed and baked on hot cookie sheets.</p1>
<h4>How do I store my bakes, such as cakes with buttercream?</h4>
<p1>Cover your sponges completely with buttercream as this helps to keep sponges from going dry in storage. Once decorated with buttercream, your cake can be stored at room temperature in a cake tin lined with greaseproof paper for up to 3 days.</p1>
<h4>Why did my bread not rise once it was baked?</h4>
<p1>Steam gives the crust of your dough the elasticity it needs to rise. If you do not have steam in your oven at the initial stages of baking, your bread will form a crust too early and will prevent it from rising and most likely cause bursts in your bread.</p1>
<h4>Can I make bread/yeast dough the night before baking?</h4>
<p1>If you want to get a head-start on your baking, letting your bread or roll dough rise in the fridge overnight can be a huge help. Chilling the dough will slow down the yeast activity, but it doesn't stop it completely.</p1>
<h4>How do I know if my baking powder and baking soda are still fresh?</h4>
<p1>Check the date expiry first, after which it might work but lose its potency.For baking soda: take  a teaspoon of baking soda and pour ¼ cup of vinegar, it should frizzle. For baking powder: take a teaspoon of baking powder and pout ¼ cup of boiling water, it should bubble up.</p1>
